If you see a lot of photos with Mr. Fu Xiqiu standing together with those poor Chinese who he claimed he ‘saved’ from China, you’ll certainly feel obliged to take out your wallet and donate your breakfast money.

You might think a pastor like Mr. Bob Fu shouldn’t invest in any business that are alcohol-related. 

Mr. Fu has another for-profit company, called Bob Fu International LLC.

Under Bob Fu International LLC, there is another company named 

‘Bill’s Bottle Shop’.

What line of business is Bill’s Bottle Shop in?

Definitely not selling empty bottles.

Anybody has been there?

    <img src="../../../../image/dt/fxq15.png"/>
</center>

Bill’s Bottle Shop is listed as a liquor store on commercial advertising websites.

</center>

How about the revenue of Bob Fu International LLC?

Its annual revenue is US$11,2411. 

Bochun Cai is listed as a major principal of Bob Fu International LLC.

Sometimes changing the name might be a good way to escape investigation.

Tax ID won’t lie though.

Bill’s Bottle Shop 

Tax ID 320492278642

Bob Fu International LLC 

Tax ID 320492278642

They share the same TAX ID?

</center>

How do I know Bochun Cai is the wife of Fu Xiqiu, or Bob Fu?

This couple is everywhere trying to promote their ‘charity’ organization China Aid Association Inc., a non-for-profit company. 

Remember it’s not a church.

By the way, when did people start calling Bob Fu, Pastor Fu?

Where did Mr. Fu get the title? 

In this 2012 New York Times article, 👇Bob Fu was still referred by renown reporter as ‘Mr. Fu.’

If he were a pastor, they’d use the title, right?

Just saying!

</center>

Now that some of my old tweets about Mr. Fu have been covered or erased by twitter.

It made me wonder maybe there’s some truth in Mr. Guo Wengui’s exposes when he claimed Mr. Fu is a  CCP agent with a registered number. 

The following 👇is the video in which Mr. Guo talked about how Mr. Fu bullied those Chinese who were seeking political asylum making big profits out of it.

Somehow I find it extremely strange that a pastor like Bob Fu would write a book called ‘God’s Double Agent.’

Why would God approve espionage?

Maybe Mr. Guo Wengui has a point?

What’s a double agent?

double agent-

“an agent who pretends to act as a spy for one country or organization while in fact acting on behalf of an enemy.”

So, is Mr. Bob Fu a double agent for God or for some other country?
