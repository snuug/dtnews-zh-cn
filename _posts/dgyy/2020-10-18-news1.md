Mr. **Bob Fu, (aka Xiqiu Fu, aka 傅希秋)**

claimed he attended the Tiannmen protests but luckily escaped the bloody crackdown because his then girlfriend, now wife, Bochun Cai, 蔡伯春coincidentally got sick, and they were both arrested but released unharmed afterwards.

Do you believe in storytelling?

On May 9, 1996, Fu & his wife Bochun Cai, were detained but got released with 'good health' on July 8, 1996. 

Incredible. 

It’s not like Chinese Communist Party’s practice at all.

I don’t know who gave the information to the media, but 

in this article in 2012, 

“ Bob Fu: The Pastor of China's Underground Railroad”

it clearly says, Mr. Bob Fu <font color="red">‘never became a party member.’ </font>

Party here refers to Chinese Communist Party.

On Mr. Fu’s wikipedia page, it states Mr. Fu worked as an English teacher in Chinese Communist Party’s Central School in Beijing. (中共北京市中央黨校, or 中共北京市中央党校)

My question: Can a non-CCP member teach at its Central Party School?

<center>

</center>

If one has to be a Chinese Communist Party(CCP) member to teach at CCP’s Central Party school, then how could Mr. Bob Fu be accepted to teach English at Beijing’s Central Party School if he was not a CCP member? 

Look at his work permit ar Beijing Central Party School.(中共北京市委党校）

It stated Mr. Bob Fu was an official at Language Training Department.

Remember, 

Bob Fu was not teaching some small school, but the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Party School (中央黨校 or 中央党校), a cradle for the most loyal CCP party members, as CCP would call it.

How could the Chinese Communist Party(CCP) allow a non-CCP-member to teach its future elites?

Mr. Fu’s supporters might argue that Chinese Communist Party accepted non-CCP-party members as teachers at Central Party School. 

Ok, here’re some logical questions:

<b><center>1.	Could it be possible that an authoritarian party like Chinese Communist Party was more progressive than it is now?</center></b>

To answer the first question, we have to compare the job requirements of CCP’s Central Party School at two periods of time.

At present, we can’t find the job qualification requirements for CCP’s Chinese Central Party in the 1990s, but we are able to locate a more recent  recruitment announcement for its Central Party School job openings.

The following image👇 is a screenshot of CCP’s announcement of job openings for Chinese Communist Party’s Central Party School in 2020.

    <img src="../../../../image/dt/fxq_3_7.png"/>
</center>

There’re many qualification requirements. Here we pay special attention to item 6. 

<font color="red">Item 6: You must be a Chinese Communist Party member.</font>


In 2020, you must be a Chinese Communist Party member so that you can apply for ANY post at the CCP’s Central Party School.

So, is it possible that in 1994, CCP was so relaxed with requirements of its Central Party School job applicants?

#傅希秋

<b><center>2.	Why does a political party need a Central Party School to train its members?</center></b>

To answer the second question, we have to go back to examine the other requirements.

All applicants should

1) Possess nationality of People’s Republic of  China 

2) 

●	Possess firm political stance

●	Embrace socialism 

●	Pledge allegiance to the leadership of Chinese  Communist Party 

So, CCP’s Central Party School only accepts loyal party believers as its staff. They don’t allow any doubt on the party’s leadership.

Why would CCP permit a non-party member to train its most loyal members at the Central Party School?

What would happen if the teacher lectures some skepticism on Communism in class?

Why is it crucial to know whether Mr. Bob Fu has been a CCP member or not? 

If Mr. Fu hadn’t applied for political asylum status from the US and became a naturalized citizen, maybe it’s not that important.

From the activities that Mr. Bob Fu is engaging in the U.S., we assume that Mr. Fu is now a naturalized American citizen as he could operate both non-profit & for-profit companies in the USA, not to mention purchasing real estates.

If Mr. Bob Fu has filled in the application of applying for a green card or being American citizen, he should have been asked whether he had been a Communist Party member.

The following is a paragraph from a legal expert on Immigration law  practice,

<center>
    <img src="../../../../image/dt/fxq_3_9.png"/>
</center>

<font color="blue">“Generally, membership in the Communist Party is a bar to immigration to the United States.  According to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) §212(a)(3)(D)(i), any immigrant who is or has been a member of or affiliated with the Communist or any other totalitarian party, domestic or foreign, is inadmissible. </font>
<p><p>

<font color="blue">There are several exceptions and it is the applicant’s burden of proof to establish that he or she falls under one of the enumerated exceptions.”</font>
<p><p>

<font color="blue">Link to Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) §212(a)(3)(D)(i)</font>
</p>

</center>
<p><p>

It’s obvious we couldn’t access his application form, so there’s no way to know whether he ticked Yes or No as to the question of ever being a Chinese Communist Party member.<p><p>

If his answer is No, then we’d like to repeat the question. <p><p>

<b>Mr. Bob Fu, </b><font color="red">please explain why you could teach at Chinese Communist Party’s Central Party School if you were a non-party member.</font><p><p>

Or, if Mr. Bob Fu had been a Communist Party member, he should have indicated  it in his application for US citizenship. <p><p>

Then, there is no way Mr. Fu could become a naturalized US citizen unless he had a good reason why he was forced to join the Chinese Communist Party.<p><p>

Let’s not go into the exempted cases just yet before we find out the answer from Mr. Fu to our question.
