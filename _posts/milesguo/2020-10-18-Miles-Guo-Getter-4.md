10月18日 班农先生接受Sky News采访爆料：亨特·拜登当时送修电脑时已经喝多了，竟然记不清送到了哪家店；美国主流媒体和科技巨头也被精英们收买了，推特竟然指控这些信息来自黑客，而实际是来自亨特·拜登主动送上的硬盘

Oct 18, Bannon Interviewed with Sky News by releasing a breaking news: Hunter Biden cannot even remember which repair store he dropped off his laptop as he was drunk when he dropped it off; the mainstream media and big Tech were bought off by the elites and Twitter even alleged hackered materials, but instead it’s from the hard drives - turned in by Hunter Biden.
