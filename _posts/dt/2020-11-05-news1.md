Dear Mister President, you give us strength and hope because of the job that you do.  You will win and defeat the CCP virus, we’ll pray for you and America,  because you know just what to do. 

You are our rock, our guiding light to the nation and to the world.  Only you can lead us, with your strength.  For you know what to do.  We pray you’ll be our President, for another four more years. 

You are a champion of liberty and freedom, from sea to shining sea.   You will bring us peace,  you will bring us hope, and make a better place for you and for me. 

We pray you’ll be our President, for another four more years.  For another four more years.   For another four more years.  For another four more years.
